## Introduction

The Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali festival to gain insights into customer behavior, improve customer experience, and optimize sales strategies. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we aim to identify patterns and trends in the data to make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains sales data during the Diwali festival, including details such as customer demographics, product categories, and sales quantities. It provides a comprehensive view of customer preferences and sales performance.

The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

  1. To Identify Potential Customers: Analyze customer demographics, including states, occupations, gender, and age groups, to identify potential customers. This information will help in targeting specific customer segments and tailoring marketing strategies to improve customer experience.
